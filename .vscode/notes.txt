To build CGO cross platform using native components (such as sqlite3):

- https://github.com/bep/dockerfiles/tree/master/ci-goreleaser
- https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/708

Create Docker (no CGO - headaches with )


Questions for Rex:

* Why multiple routing numbers for an account?
* I assume we do not show checks in GetAccountTransactions (only with GetAccountTransaction?inline=true?)
* Why muliple images while there is only one checkNumber for a transaction?
* When to throw 500 or 400 (for example: "Image does not belong to account")?
* Unclear what /cloud/v1/account/{accountId}/image/{itemId} returns (a binary image?)
* GetCards API inconsistent: payload provides for limit & cursor info... parameters do not
* Which fields are marked for mask / enchance?
* When no cards are found for an account, do we return an "empy" CardsList or 404?

Release notes:
* Issue: /cloud/v1/account/{accountId}/image/{itemId} returns incorrect Content-Type and wrong encoding
