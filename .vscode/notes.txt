Create Docker (no CGO - headaches with )


Questions for Rex:

* Why multiple routing numbers for an account?
    --> can only have one, is inconsistent
    --> update emulator with single routing number

* Why muliple images while there is only one checkNumber for a transaction?
    --> front and back

* Unclear what /cloud/v1/account/{accountId}/image/{itemId} returns (a binary image?)
    --> Should be uuencoded (example to be provided)

* GetCards API inconsistent: payload provides for limit & cursor info... parameters do not
    --> To be looked into

* Which fields are marked for mask / enhanced?
    --> mask: PII enabled or not (mask)
    --> enhance: will be provided by Rex (list)

* Which operators are supported within the search API?
    --> Documented (duh)

* I assume all searches are AND?
    --> Yes

* Search API should be scoped to an accountId
    --> Updated openapi spec by Rex


Release notes:
* Issue: /cloud/v1/account/{accountId}/image/{itemId} returns incorrect Content-Type and wrong encoding
